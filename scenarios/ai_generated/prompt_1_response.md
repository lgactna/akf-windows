To create a scenario where a user visits news-related websites using Microsoft Edge and entertainment-related sites using Google Chrome while powering their computer on and off at least three times, we can structure the declarative script as follows:

```yaml
name: Browser Usage Scenario
description: A user visits news and entertainment websites with different browsers and powers the computer multiple times.
author: Your Name
seed: "1234"
libraries:
  - akflib.modules
  - akf_windows.modules

actions:
  # Action 1: Start the virtual machine
  - name: Power on the virtual machine
    module: vbox_start_machine

  # Action 2: Visit news-related websites with Microsoft Edge
  - name: Visit news sites using Microsoft Edge
    module: chromium_visit_urls
    args:
      browser: "msedge"
      urls:
        - "https://www.news.com"
        - "https://www.nytimes.com"

  # Action 3: Power off the virtual machine
  - name: Power off the virtual machine
    module: vbox_stop_machine

  # Action 4: Restart the virtual machine and visit news sites again
  - name: Restart the virtual machine
    module: vbox_start_machine

  # Action 5: Visit entertainment-related websites with Google Chrome
  - name: Visit entertainment sites using Google Chrome
    module: chromium_visit_urls
    args:
      browser: "chromium"
      urls:
        - "https://www.entertainment.com"
        - "https://www.imdb.com"

  # Action 6: Power off the virtual machine again
  - name: Power off the virtual machine again
    module: vbox_stop_machine

  # Action 7: Restart the virtual machine and visit sites one more time
  - name: Restart the virtual machine for the final time
    module: vbox_start_machine

  # Action 8: Visit news-related websites once more with Microsoft Edge
  - name: Final visit to news sites using Microsoft Edge
    module: chromium_visit_urls
    args:
      browser: "msedge"
      urls:
        - "https://www.news.com"

  # Action 9: Power off the virtual machine for the last time
  - name: Final power off of the virtual machine
    module: vbox_stop_machine
```

### Explanation:

1. **Starting the Virtual Machine**:
   - The scenario begins by starting the virtual machine using `vbox_start_machine`. This ensures that all subsequent actions occur within a running environment.

2. **Visiting News Websites with Microsoft Edge**:
   - Using `chromium_visit_urls` with `browser: "msedge"`, the script directs the user to visit specified news websites. The URLs provided are examples and can be customized as needed.

3. **First Shutdown**:
   - After visiting the news sites, the virtual machine is powered off using `vbox_stop_machine`.

4. **Restarting for Entertainment Websites with Google Chrome**:
   - The virtual machine is restarted to begin a new session. This time, `chromium_visit_urls` is used with `browser: "chromium"` to direct the user to entertainment-related websites.

5. **Second Shutdown**:
   - Following the visit to entertainment sites, another shutdown occurs.

6. **Final Restart and News Visit**:
   - The virtual machine restarts once more, allowing for a final visit to news sites using Microsoft Edge.

7. **Final Shutdown**:
   - The scenario concludes with the virtual machine being powered off for the last time.

This structured approach ensures that the user interacts with different browsers on multiple restarts, meeting the requirement of powering the computer on and off at least three times.
