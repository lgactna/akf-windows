> Alright, so I need to create a declarative script based on the given prompt. Let me start by understanding the requirements.
> 
> The user wants a scenario where a user conducts research about artificial intelligence using Google Chrome but uses Microsoft Edge exclusively for personal purposes. Also, the machine needs to be powered on and off at least twice during the scenario.
> 
> First, I'll break down the steps needed:
> 
> 1. **Initialize CASE bundle**: This is always the first step in any scenario to set up logging and reporting. The module `create_akf_bundle` is used here.
> 
> 2. **Powering up the VM**: Since the machine needs to be powered on twice, I should structure the script so that it starts, does some actions, stops, then starts again for more actions, and finally stops.
> 
> 3. **Browser Actions**:
>    - Using Google Chrome for research: This involves starting Chromium (since both Chrome and Edge are based on Chromium), visiting AI research URLs.
>    - Using Microsoft Edge for personal purposes: Similarly, but with different URLs.
> 
> 4. **Collecting Artifacts**: After each session, I need to collect the browsing history using `chromium_history`.
> 
> 5. **Writing and Rendering Reports**: At the end, write the CASE bundle to a file and generate a PDF report.
> 
> Now, considering dependencies:
> 
> - `vbox_start` must be called before any VM actions.
> - Starting Chromium services requires the VM to be running (`vbox_start_machine`).
> - After collecting artifacts, stopping the services is good practice.
> 
> I should also ensure that after each major action (like starting browsers), I collect the history. This means I'll have two separate sessions for Chrome and Edge, each with their own set of actions and artifact collection.
> 
> Putting it all together:
> 
> 1. Start VM.
> 2. Start Chromium service for Chrome research, visit AI URLs, collect history.
> 3. Stop services and artifacts.
> 4. Stop VM.
> 5. Start VM again.
> 6. Start Chromium service for Edge personal use, visit personal sites, collect history.
> 7. Stop services and artifacts.
> 8. Stop VM.
> 9. Finally, write the report.
> 
> I need to make sure each action is properly ordered and that all dependencies are met. Also, libraries must be correctly specified as given.
> 
> Double-checking module arguments:
> 
> - `chromium_visit_urls` needs either `urls` or `file`. I'll use `urls` for each browser.
> - Disk image creation requires stopping the machine first, but since we're stopping anyway after each session, that's covered.
> 
> I think this structure meets all requirements. Now, I'll draft the YAML accordingly, making sure each action is correctly sequenced and arguments are properly passed.

name: Browser Usage Scenario
description: A scenario where a user conducts research using Google Chrome and personal browsing using Microsoft Edge, with the virtual machine being powered on and off twice.

- name: Create disk image
  module: create_disk_image
```

This scenario:
1. Initializes the CASE bundle for tracking artifacts
2. Powers on the VM twice (once at the beginning and once after restarting)
3. Uses Google Chrome for AI research by visiting academic websites
4. Uses Microsoft Edge for personal browsing by visiting personal websites
5. Collects browser history from both sessions separately
6. Powers off the machine twice
7. Writes out the final report and optionally creates a disk image

The scenario captures both professional (Chrome) and personal (Edge) browsing activities while ensuring proper system state transitions between power cycles.
